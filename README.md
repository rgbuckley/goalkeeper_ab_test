# Project Overview
This project shows how to solve the hypothetical use case:

> _A soccer coach has three goalkeepers on her roster. She wants to figure out which is the best at saving penalty kicks. This will allow her to decide if she would like to substitute the goalkeeper if the team goes into a penalty shootout._ 

The project simulates several approaches to solving this problem including:
- Epsilon Greedy
- Optimistic Initial Values
- Upper Confidence Bound
- Bayesian Learning

After discussing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, the coach selects a method and we run the experiment to determine the best goalkeeper.

# Extending the Project

This project explores how a coach might use data to determine which goalkeeper on her roster has the highest save rate. The applications for this kind of algorithm, however, are much broader than sports. Similar approaches could be used for:

- a marketing analyst determining which ad has the highest click-through rate
- a drug manufacturer determining which drug is most effective
- a manager determining which price is most likely to convince a customer to buy a product

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by a [crazy penalty shootout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013_FIFA_Confederations_Cup_knockout_stage#Spain_vs_Italy) from 2013, when Spain and Italy made 12 straight penalties against some of the best goalkeepers of all time.
